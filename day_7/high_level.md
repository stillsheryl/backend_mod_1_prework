# Checker board

After writing code that involved creating a class, I re-read the instructions and realized that the instructions specify that the user needs to input the size, so I had to re-write the program to take in user input.


By doing this I realized that I had made the code way more convoluted than I needed to, so I was able to simplify the program and rather than make a Class, I made a simple method that takes in a number from the user and runs a block of code as many times as is equal to the number given by the user.


The program starts by asking the user what size they want the board to be, and takes the user input and converts it to an integer.


This integer will determine the number of time the .times method runs. As each integer passes, it will print out either the 3 Xâ€™s with no space in the front or a space in the front, depending on whether the number is odd or even. I went back and forth between using the .odd? function and the modulus, but decided the odd function is more straightforward and easier to read and understand.
